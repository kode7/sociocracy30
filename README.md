# Svens Sociocracy 3.0 Diagrams
A collections of diagrams I made to learn and teach Sociocracy 3.0. Everybody is welcome to use the diagrams as she or he likes. If you have own diagrams you want to share contact me (slatzel@hotmail.com) and I can share them through this project.

## SVG files
All SVG files are created and editable with Inkscape. This is a open source vector grafic editor. You can download it from https://inkscape.org/en/.

## BPMN files
You don't know what BPMN is or you forgot the most of it :-), then have a look at http://www.bpmb.de/images/BPMN2_0_Poster_EN.pdf
All *.bpmn files are created with http://demo.bpmn.io.
